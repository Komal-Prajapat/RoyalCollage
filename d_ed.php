    DEd or Diploma in Education is a certificate-level teacher training programme that equips candidates to become nursery school teachers. The course basically caters to elementary-level education in India and is an important job-oriented programme in the field of education.  Depending on the university/ college to which a candidate applies for admission, the duration of the DEd course varies from one to three years. The minimum duration to complete the course also varies from institute to institute. The course, however, is available as a both full-time and part-time programme. Admission to the DEd programme is usually offered on the basis of candidates’ performance in the written entrance test conducted at the university/ institute level. However, some institutions also offer direct admission to candidates on the basis of merit. The merit list is prepared by the officials on the basis of candidates’ marks in Class 12th exams.
